# uCoin [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/ucoin-io/ucoin.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ucoin-io/ucoin)

uCoin is a free server-side software allowing to create new P2P crypto-currencies based on individuals and Universal Dividend.

It is mainly inspired from [OpenUDC project](https://github.com/Open-UDC/open-udc) for that purpose, but differs defining its own open currency protocol called UCP (UCoin Protocol).

## Development state

Software is still under development, and is not used yet. **This means no currency using uCoin exists for now**.

However, it is hoped to build a new currency in a near future according to the following roadmap:

1. Several POCs (prototypes) of uCoin will be released (first during August/September 2014)
2. Code adaptation, cleaning, unit tests
3. Beta testing with volunteer people

> uCoin is server-side software and will require client GUI to be (easily) used. **Feel free to propose yours!**
